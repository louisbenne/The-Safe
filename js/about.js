    <li><strong>v3.35.82 &ndash; STRK-315: The sync popup really stops appearing now</strong>: Last release chased this same bug into the catalog API settings, but the setting actually changing was the other one &mdash; your spot price API config. It keeps a private tally of how many price requests each device has made, tucked in beside the API keys, and the free built-in THE SAFE feed refreshes on every app launch. So the tally ticked up on each device every time you opened THE SAFE, even if you have never entered an API key at all, and Review Sync Changes opened to report it. Those tallies are now ignored when deciding whether settings changed, while the quota limits you set yourself still sync. That row is also renamed <strong>Spot API Config</strong> &mdash; it always covered your selected feed, cache timing and per-metal choices too, not just keys &mdash; and the matched settings listed at the bottom of that window, which used to show blank values and a stray &ldquo;not set&rdquo; for keys you definitely had, now show what they actually hold (STRK-315).</li>
    <li><strong>v3.35.81 &ndash; STRK-313: Cloud sync stops crying wolf about your catalog API key</strong>: If you sync between two devices or sites, the Review Sync Changes window kept insisting your Numista key had changed &mdash; &ldquo;configured &rarr; configured&rdquo; &mdash; when it never had. The culprit was an internal counter of catalog lookups stored next to the key, ticking up separately on each device. Sync now ignores those counters when deciding whether settings changed, so the popup only appears for a genuine key, token, or quota change, and switching between synced sessions is noticeably calmer (STRK-313).</li>
    <li><strong>v3.35.80 &ndash; The header is now a single clean row</strong>: Eight buttons have left the top of the screen. Every one of them duplicated something you could already reach elsewhere, and each has moved to where it belongs: <strong>Backup</strong> and <strong>Restore</strong> to <strong>Settings &rsaquo; System</strong>, which holds the full import and export surface, <strong>Cloud Sync</strong> to <strong>Settings &rsaquo; Cloud</strong>, <strong>Info</strong> to <strong>Settings &rsaquo; About</strong>, and <strong>Currency</strong> to <strong>Settings &rsaquo; Currency &rsaquo; Display currency</strong>. <strong>Trend</strong> and <strong>Spot Sync</strong> moved down onto the spot cards themselves &mdash; the period chip and the refresh icon on each card do the same job closer to the prices they affect. You will notice the currency one most, since it was the only button visible by default. Nothing you could do before has been taken away, and the header keeps <strong>Theme</strong> and <strong>Settings</strong> (STRK-283 to STRK-289, STRK-298).</li>
    <li><strong>v3.35.79 &ndash; The market Refresh button now actually refreshes</strong>: The <strong>&#8635; Refresh</strong> button above the market price table was quietly doing nothing most of the time &mdash; it only fetched new prices if your data was already over an hour old, and any sooner it greyed out, spun for five seconds, put the same prices back and gave no hint that it had skipped the fetch. It now pulls fresh vendor prices every time you click it, and stays in its working state until the fetch genuinely finishes. The <strong>Market</strong> button left the header along with it; its green, orange and red freshness dot moved down beside the market table&rsquo;s timestamp, and <strong>Settings &rsaquo; Market &rsaquo; Sync Now</strong> is untouched (STRK-290).</li>
    <li><strong>v3.35.71 &ndash; Metal ratios, with an app of their own</strong>: The gold-to-silver ratio and its three companions &mdash; gold to platinum, gold to palladium, and platinum to palladium &mdash; now have a proper home. The silver, platinum and palladium spot cards each carry a small ratio chip, and clicking one opens a full panel with the current reading set against its own history, so you can see whether today is high or low by that measure rather than guessing. The gold card carries a chip too, showing the daily Goldback G1 rate; that one stays a plain readout rather than a link, since it is a price and not a ratio. The same panel is also a standalone page at <strong>/ratios/</strong> that installs to your home screen as its own app with its own icon, separate from the main tracker &mdash; useful if ratios are what you check most often (STRK-268 to STRK-274).</li>
